# assumptions  
You solemnly swear you're up to no good.  
You understand that this is a work in progress.  
I use this on my production systems.  
If you don't understand this codebase thoroughly, don't use it on live.

# disclaimer
Shell scripts are dangerous.  
This one moreso than most.  
If you break something with this tool you borrow from me, that's on you.  

Submit a bug report and explain what happened, and I'll try to fix it.  
I also accept pull requests.
