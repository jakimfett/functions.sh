# functions.sh
Several shell scripts stacked on top of eachother, attempting to be useful.

# assumptions
You solemnly swear you're up to no good.
You understand that this is a work in progress.
I use this on my production systems.
If you don't understand this codebase thoroughly, don't use it on live.

# disclaimer
Shell scripts are dangerous.
This one moreso than some.
If you break something with a borrowed tool, that's on you.

This particular set of scripts is optimized for use inside the Bourne-Again shell v4.x (and above) on a 2019-current-ish Debian/Raspbian system, in a homelab.

You CentOS/RedHat/BeOS/BSD/Unix/etc experience may be debuging-laden.

Bugfix and other contributions welcome.
