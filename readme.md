# functions.sh
Several shell scripts stacked on top of eachother, attempting to be useful.

# epilogue
To be perfectly honest, there's too much [Voodoo Programming](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/V/voodoo-programming.html) and application-specific [heavy wizardry](https://archive.today/dFQHC) in this codebase for it to ever really be considered "safe" for anything but educational use.

This is what we consider the main codebase for `v0.2.x` through `0.8.x`, and  
if you learn something from it, we'd love to hear from you, [reach out](mailto:jakimfett@assorted.tech).

Some bits, especially `com/core.sh` and `f.sh`, alongside `com/usr/aliases.src`, have been heavily cannibalized for `v0.9.x` and beyond, see [functions.sh](https://functions.sh) for up-to-date versions.

# assumptions
You solemnly swear you're up to no good.  
You understand that this is a work in progress.  
You will understand what something does before executing it.

# disclaimer
Shell scripts are dangerous.  
This one moreso than some.  
If you break something with a borrowed tool, that's on you.

This particular set of scripts is optimized for use inside the Bourne-Again shell v4.x (and above) on a 2019-current-ish Debian/Raspbian system, in a homelab.

You CentOS/RedHat/BeOS/BSD/Unix/etc experience may be debuging-laden.

Bugfix and other contributions welcome.
