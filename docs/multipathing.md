Managing state is complicated. Why should a simple three-liner of a shell script need one?

Because most computer programs are convoluted, overcomplex, under-documented, and frequently [Just Plain Bad](doc://defs.md#Bbad_code).

The key is abstraction and identity.

My shell is unique.  
Yours probably is, too.
That's because the shell's "state" is in flux, just like your entire user account, your data, your connection, etc etc.  

There's a lot of chaos in the process, and frequently, things get lost in the shuffle.  
Documents. Lives. Love.

You know, the important things.

But  
Just that stateement, is why this particular scripting language is possible. 

In code, as with life, the ideal, the vision, is a poor rendering indeed in the final product.

This is an alternate approach.  
It has worked for me.

It may, or may not, work for you.

Judge lightly.  
Understand deeply.  
Criticize constructively.
